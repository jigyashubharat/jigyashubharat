I'm Jigyashu, a frontend developer based in India.

I love building smooth, clean, and user-focused UIs especially websites and fun little animations.

If an idea hits me, there’s a good chance I’ll try to build it and see how far I can push it.

My main tech stack is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I’m currently exploring animations as a beginner with GSAP.
My favorite tools are VS Code and Figma.

One of my favorite projects so far is my Crypto Dashboard, where I’ve been learning how to build production-style UI with charts and APIs.

I’ve built 10+ projects, and I’m learning by building more every week.

Fun Facts:

I enjoy gaming in my free time

I like creating random videos for fun

I’m always experimenting with new UI ideas

Big fan of clean design + smooth interactions
